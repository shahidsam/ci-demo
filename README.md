CI/CD Pipeline: Multi-Environment Deployment (Dev ‚Üí Staging ‚Üí Prod)

This project demonstrates a complete CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions, Docker, and a Linux VM as a deployment target.
It covers automated testing, image building, multi-environment deployment, approval gates, Slack notifications, and secrets management.

| Stage                 | Purpose                | Description                                                                |
| --------------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Test**              | Continuous Integration | Runs automated unit tests using `pytest` and uploads reports.              |
| **Build**             | Build & Publish        | Builds Docker image and pushes it to GitHub Container Registry (GHCR).     |
| **Deploy to Dev**     | Continuous Delivery    | Automatically deploys the built image to a dev environment (port 5000).    |
| **Deploy to Staging** | QA/Pre-Production      | Deploys the same image to staging environment (port 5001) for testing.     |
| **Deploy to Prod**    | Production Deployment  | Deploys to production environment (port 80) with **manual approval** gate. |
| **Notify**            | Slack Notification     | Sends a Slack message after successful production deployment.              |

üß© Technologies Used

*) GitHub Actions ‚Äì CI/CD automation

*) Docker ‚Äì Containerization

*) GHCR (GitHub Container Registry) ‚Äì Image hosting

*) Slack Webhook ‚Äì Deployment notifications

*) SSH ‚Äì Secure remote deployments

*) Python + Pytest ‚Äì Example application and test framework

‚öôÔ∏è Environment Setup
1. Create GitHub Environments

Go to:
Settings ‚Üí Environments ‚Üí New Environment

Create:
*) dev
*) staging
*) production

| Secret Name         | Description                                    |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY`   | Private SSH key to connect to VM               |
| `SERVER_IP`         | Target server‚Äôs IP address                     |
| `SERVER_USER`       | Server username (e.g., ubuntu, root)           |
| `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` | Slack incoming webhook URL (for notifications) |

üßæ Workflow Overview (.github/workflows/ci.yml)

The pipeline runs automatically when code is pushed to:

* main
* develop
* release/* branches.

Job Flow
*) test ‚Üí build ‚Üí deploy-dev ‚Üí deploy-staging ‚Üí deploy-prod ‚Üí notify
*) Production job requires manual approval before running.

| Environment | URL Example                | Port |
| ----------- | -------------------------- | ---- |
| Dev         | http\://\<SERVER\_IP>:5000 | 5000 |
| Staging     | http\://\<SERVER\_IP>:5001 | 5001 |
| Prod        | http\://\<SERVER\_IP>      | 80   |

Check running containers:

ssh <SERVER_USER>@<SERVER_IP>
docker ps
